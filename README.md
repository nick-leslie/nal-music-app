# nal-music-app
The goal of this project is to build a rust app that can be used to showcase my proficiency as a developer.

## how to run
1) First, make sure you have the Rust programing language configured and installed on your system.

2) Then use git clone to pull down the source code.

3) Enter the newly created directory (cd)

3) type cargo run --release /path_to_your_music_dir in your console of choice
This should cause the app to run.

## extra thoughts
As of right now, I will not explain how to build to a binary because many features are still missing, and I am not ready for it to be used as an everyday product.

as of right now, the project has only been tested on Manjaro Linux so its stability on Windows and Mac is unknown

Finally, this is meant as a showcase of skill rather than an actual everyday product; however, if you would like to, you a free to use it.
