# nal-music-app

The goal of this project is to build a rust app that can be used to showcase my proficiency as a developer.


## how to run

1. First make sure you have the Rust programing language configured an installed on your system.

2. the use git clone to pull down the source code.

3. enter the newly created directory and type cargo run --release /path_to_your_music_dir in your console of choise

this should cause the app to run.

## extra thoughts

As of right now, I will not explain how to build to a binary because many features are still missing, and I am not ready for it to be used as an everyday product.

as of right now the project has only been tested on manjaro linux so its stability on windows and mac is unknown

finaly this is ment as a showcase of skill rather than an actualy every day product however if you would like to you a free to use it.
